# CACCommonAppSorter

## What
This is a project for Campus Activities Council (CAC). Every semester (2 times per year) CAC does a big Common Application for their executive committees. 
In the past the preferences of applicatants and committees had to be hand read and the members hand sorted to the different execs. The purpose of this 
application is to take over the sorting process and handle the placement to all the various CAC execs
